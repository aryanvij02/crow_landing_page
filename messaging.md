## **The Problem**

Investors spend hours copying numbers from documents, scanning emails for updates, and juggling spreadsheets to understand market shifts.
Good deals go unseen because they’re buried in inboxes or dismissed too early. When terms change, few investors ever circle back—and the upside is lost.

You’re not missing deals because you lack judgment. You’re missing them because your data is fragmented.

---

## **The Solution**

Crow unifies every input that shapes an investment decision. It pulls data from your inbox, documents, and the web, then underwrites the deal automatically—faster and more accurately than any manual process.

It doesn’t just extract data. It understands your investment logic and refines it over time.

**Key Capabilities:**

* **Automated Underwriting:** Converts unstructured data into full financial models with NOI, IRR, DSCR, LTC, and DCF outputs.
* **Investor Intelligence:** Learns your past deals, preferences, and return targets to build a digital clone of how you underwrite.
* **Continuous Deal Tracking:** Monitors every opportunity you’ve ever reviewed. If updated terms or new data make a deal fit your criteria later, Crow surfaces it automatically.
* **Market Context:** Integrates real-time rent comps, cap-rate trends, and sales benchmarks.
* **AI Copilot:** Collaborate with an analyst that never guesses—only verifies and validates against hard data.
